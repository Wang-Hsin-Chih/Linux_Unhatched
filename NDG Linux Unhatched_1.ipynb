    "Hello, and welcome to the NDG Linux Unhatched Module! We are very excited to offer you this short introduction to the world of Linux. Before you get started, we would like to take the opportunity to explain the intent and scope of this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not be concerned if you have little or no Linux experience. This module is designed as an introduction for beginning learners without previous Linux training. If you find this material useful, you may consider continuing with our NDG Linux Essentials or NDG Introduction to Linux courses to build additional knowledge. Additional information regarding these courses can be found at the end of this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you may already be aware, the Linux kernel has found its way into an incredible number of diverse systems. It can now be found in everything from automobiles to rockets, watches to televisions, and netbooks to the fastest supercomputers. Linux only accounts for a relatively small percentage of the operating systems found on desktop computers, but has gained widespread use in servers, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, networking equipment, smartphones, and many other devices you may not think of as even being computers. From the home router providing your Internet connection to the server this course is hosted on, it is likely that multiple Linux powered devices are currently enabling you to read this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We hope that you find the NDG Linux Unhatched Module helpful. Congratulations on taking your first steps into the world of Linux!"

    "# Why Learn Linux?\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of Information Technology (IT) is full of opportunities. For individuals who wish to pursue a career in IT, one of the biggest challenges can be deciding how to get started. Often, people are motivated to learn new skills that will enable them to pursue bigger and better opportunities in both their personal and professional lives. Learning a new skill takes time and discipline, but with the right motivation, it doesn’t have to be painful. In this section, we will discuss why the time and effort you invest in learning Linux will be beneficial to you; and remember, everyone working in IT had to start somewhere.\n",

    "# What is Linux?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we determine what makes Linux such a great asset to your skill-set, let’s define it first. Linux is operating system software that runs on a hardware computer system. An operating system is software that allows other programs like word processors and web browsers to be installed and run on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your cell phone, tablet, laptop and desktop all need an operating system to run the software (often called applications) you want to use. This means that Linux is not limited to only desktops and laptops, and we will expand on that as we continue our discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason why learning Linux is useful is that Linux is used almost everywhere! Linux is used on desktop and laptop computers, web servers, mobile devices (Android), public cloud technology (i.e., Google, Amazon, etc), Chromebooks, and networking (i.e., Cisco Networks). Although you may not have ever used Linux on a desktop or laptop, **<font> it is likely that you are using other technology that runs on Linux </font>** such as a mobile phone running Android, a tablet or popular websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon. In fact, it is estimated that servers running Linux generate over half of the web pages on the internet."

A GUI displays icons and images that you can select to tell your device what you want to do or use. Behind the GUI, is a code that a programmer developed. When you click on an icon or folder in a GUI, it sends a command to the code telling the system what to do.\n",
